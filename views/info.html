            <h1>Info</h1>
            <p>MyPictures is a web application developed by three students from the College of Computer Science, University of Ia&#351;i.</p>
            <p>This is an aggregator-type web application through which a user
            is able to manage the photos he has stored on Unsplash or Twitter.
            The application takes personal images posted on the mentioned platforms together with comments, 
            ratings or other elements of interest about them: tags, number of shares, dimensions. Local photos can be uploaded too. 
            The application also provides multi-criteria search facilities and new photos uploads to 
            Twitter. The images can be edited within the application by applying various CSS filters, 
            defining masks or by making various CSS animations.
            The images, together with the processing performed on them, can be made available publicly 
            (or privately) through a REST web service.
