# Web Technology Project : M-PIC 🖼️
📝 This is an aggregator-type web application through which a user
    is able to manage the photos he has stored on various platforms that
    allow the distribution of photos (Unsplash or Twitter).
    The application takes personal images posted on the mentioned platforms together with comments, 
    ratings or other elements of interest about them: tags, number of shares, dimensions.
    The application also provides multi-criteria search facilities and new photos uploads to 
    these platforms. The images can be edited within the application by applying various CSS filters, 
    defining masks or areas of interest. These can be annotated with various keywords or used to crop 
    areas of images that can be used in making various CSS animations.
    The images, together with the processing performed on them, can be made available publicly 
    (or privately) through a REST / GraphQL web service.
